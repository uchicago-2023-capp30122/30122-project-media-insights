# Project Media Insights
Developed by Darren Colby and Jessup Jong

Get insights into your user inteaction on YouTube. This tool enables you to
quickly see trends in comments and sentiments in your videos. The time series 
predictions are powered by Prophet, a time series library developed at Facebook,
that separately models day, month, year, and autoregression components using 
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Sentiment classification is based on VADER
using preprocessed text. When conducting sentiment classification, the program 
removes emojis, newlines, tabs, carriage returns, punctuation, and numbers before
translating any foreign text to English and correcting misspelled words. This 
program allows you to visualize the similarity of competitor videos by using
the cosine similarity of the GloVe embeddings of their transcripts. Finally,
you can use the upload module to automate video uploads.

## Features

* Automate video uploads
* Can be run by double clicking a single file
* Automatic translation of comments and transcripts to English
* Automatic spelling correction
* Cosine similarities calculated based on GloVe embeddings
* Change the forecast period with a slider
* Uploads secured by OAuth

## Data Sources
* requests library to use GET requests for comment data from YouTube
* youtube_transcript_api thired party library for video transcripts
* gensim for pretrained GloVe model weights and tokens
